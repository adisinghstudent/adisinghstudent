### 🚀 About Me  
I’m Adi Singh — a **software engineer and founder** who builds and ships products fast.  
I’ve built full-stack apps, dev tools, and automation systems powered by the latest in **AI and infrastructure**.  

Previously, I founded **Dereference**, a multiprocessing IDE written in **Rust**, backed by **Entrepreneur First**, **Anthropic for Startups**, and **Google Cloud**.  
Now, I focus on **building, testing, and deploying the newest AI systems** — from local inference stacks to real-time LLM applications.


### ⚙️ What I Work On  
- 🧩 **Apps & Tools:** AI-powered developer tools, interactive UIs, and automation backends.  
- 💻 **Tech Stack:** Rust, TypeScript, Python, React, FastAPI, Docker.  
- 🤖 **AI Systems:** Prompt engineering, retrieval, context persistence, and multi-agent execution.  
- 🔬 **Testing Frontier Tech:** OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, Qwen, and Cerebras — always pushing limits.  


### 🛠 Projects I’m Proud Of  
- ⚙️ **Dereference IDE** — multiprocessing Rust IDE for LLMs with parallel agent execution and persistent context.
